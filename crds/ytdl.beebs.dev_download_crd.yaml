                description: |-
                  If `true`, ignore errors in querying individual entities. This is usually recommended for playlists and channels because the query will continue even if some videos are age restricted or otherwise not available. Set to `false` for single videos or to guarantee that every video for a playlist/channel is downloaded.

                  Equates to the `--ignore-errors` flag in `youtube-dl`.
